From academic to government data, from complex SPARQL queries to Linked Data Fragments, from DBpedia to Wikidata: the data sources on the Web of Data and the ways in which these sources can be created and consumed vary greatly and raise fundamental questions. These include: (a) What kind of usage is traceable for the different access mechanisms? (b) Which actionable conclusion can we draw from observed usage patterns? (c) What are the benefits and who are the beneficiaries of usage analysis and its applications; do these go beyond advertising and personalization?

The 6th edition of the USEWOD workshop will be dedicated to this fundamentally new diversity of data sources and access methods. We seek submissions on effective usage analysis of the diverse data sources ecosystem that the Web of Data has become. Apart from investigating aspects of the key recent developments affecting the Web of Data and its usage analysis, this theme relates to wider issues on the Web and in Web Science. These include data management and query processing architectures, search and recommendation algorithms, human computer interaction questions, and new fields arising from these, such as what could be termed H+CI: human-and-other-intelligences computer interaction.

The workshop will begin with a keynote talk and a short tutorial on the diverse ways of interacting with the Web of Data. This will be followed by scientific paper presentations. A closing panel will bring together representatives from different linked data providers as well as researchers working on linked data access mechanisms.
